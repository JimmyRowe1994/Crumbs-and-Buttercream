    <p class = "half-width">Sizes and portions of cakes depend on how the cake is cut. Below is a guide which will be with the cake on delivery so that the person cutting the cake will know how many portions they should get out of the cake. All wedding cakes are delivered by us and set up in the venue. Usually, sponge cakes are cut into 2" x 1" slices, which is known as a <em>dessert portion</em>, and fruit cakes into 1" x 1" slices, which is known as a <em>finger portion</em>.</p>
