		<p class = "half-width">Hello, I'm Ryan from Crumbs & Buttercream. Please let me give you a little overview of myself and our business: Crumbs & Buttercream was formed by myself, Ryan, and my partner, Eddy, in early 2018. However, I have been baking since I was a child and I'm absolutely in love with it. I pride myself on my work and have worked extremely hard to get to where I am now, and can only hope with continued support from old and new customers, Crumbs & Buttercream will continue to grow.</p>

		<p class = "half-width">When it comes to my baking, this is done daily for the orders that are in, and I never cook and freeze my cakes; cakes are baked freshly within 24 hours of leaving me and going to you. I always advise that cakes are best enjoyed within 48 hours if not kept in the box provided, otherwise they are best enjoyed within 4 days. Never store cakes or cupcakes in the fridge or in any airtight Tupperware.</p>

		<p>Established in 2018 we have grown from our early days in Penryn to now supply cakes across Cornwall and the rest of Great Britain, from 5-star luxury hotels to a marquee in the middle of the fabulous Cornwall countryside.</p>
		<p>Our cake studio is situated on the outside of the historic town of Penryn, only a short stroll from the fabulously stunning fishing town of Falmouth. It's a place of light, peacefullness and inspiration. From there we are able to create luxury wedding and celebration cakes and deliver them to fabulous venues across Cornwall and Great Britain.</p>
		<p>In our mind we count it an honour to work with each client to design and craft a cake that truly reflects their unique occasion or celebration. Naturally, the Crumbs & Buttercream team offer our services to the highest level.</p>
